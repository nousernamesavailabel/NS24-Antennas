This is a culmination of three years of work developing an antenna system for various international military HF competitions and exercises. Begining in 2022 the Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) became a powerhouse of HF knowledge and expertise, going on to win multiple international competitions, become a key player in global HF exercises, and even establish a multinational HF exercise of its own. It was during this year that the callsign "FLORIDA MAN" was earned by winning US Army NETCOM's annual QRPX low power HF competition.

This analysis is from the antenna system constructed for Noble Skywave 2024 (https://nobleskywave.ca), a truly gloabl HF competition that is hosted by the Canadian Forces Joint Signal Regiment (CFJSR) every October. For the second year in a row JCSE won the 0-150 watt low power category, scoring within 5% of the team that won the 400+ watt category, and beating all of the 150-400 watt teams as well. Furthermore, the JCSE team took 1st place in the 3G Group Challenge against teams from all categories. A full list of JCSE victories is available below. 


  QRPX 2022 - 1st Place
  
  NS22 - 2nd Place (Low Power)
  
  QRPX 2023 - 1st Place
  
  NS23 - 1st Place (Low Power), 3rd Overall
  
  QRPX 2024 - 1st Place
  
  NS24 - 1st Place (Low Power), 1st Place (3G Group Challenge), 2nd Overall
